# um poema cai na terra

http://umpoemacainaterra.art/

The work is a video-poem, created as a screen capture in which who reads/watches can follow the whole creation process of the poem, written and captured by Renata Froan. The intent is that viewers-readers can have an immersive experience, while the artist is creating the poem, as they were seeing exactly what she sees, in the moment of the creation. 

Besides that, viewers-readers are invited by the writer to follow her by sharing the link to the original document. In this metalinguistic endeavour, the place of whom that sees and reads and the text is tensioned each time by the ones who access the video as well as the text. The beginning always restart, never ends: the write and rewrite being an endless talk, reticent, an echo who gives time its rhythm.

“Um poema cai na terra” is part of the master research from Renata Froan, guided by prof. João Vilnei (PPGARTES — UFC), and development from José Cândido. Is based on the work “Caro Reni, ... ou de como e porque Tutunho (se) escreve”, from the artist Antonio Wellington de Oliveira Junior (Tutunho).

*OBS: this text is a loosely translation of Renata Froan poem presentation.
